## Domain, Audience, Solution/Business
- Cardano's domain is very broad, at first glance they could just be looked at as another coin that has some cool tech to go with it with pluses and minuses just like every other coin. The difference comes to light when you look into what exactly they do and what they have planned. You’ll notice that they focus a lot on governance and record keeping, this will lead you to realize that the domain is to better existing governmental systems and record keeping. The ideal audience for ADA are developing countries that have weak governmental systems, this leads directly into the solution. The solution is to assist in re-building a strong government that is trying to exist in the world banking system. Many countries fail to be included due to the FATF not accepting them due to current governance success level. By noticing that these countries can not and do not participate in the world banking system this can be a plus to ADA due to no repercussions when conducting business. This “business” is replacing the current government and currency with a more suitable system.

# Landmarks and Trends
- ADA’s  trend and landmarks, like I briefly mentioned above, ADA looks at 3rd world countries to support "a codebase offering an unrivaled level of assurance." With that being said Africa is a huge country that ADA has been in touch with and working with. As many people could notice, Africa is not in good standing nore do they have any sort of banking or governmental system that actually works like it should. ADA has started a trend in Africa first, to give everyone access to the internet and a cold storage device with a local CBDC. This brough 4 Million Africans internet and a way to do proper business transactions and to properly build wealth that can not be simply taken from said person. I consider this a trend because many people can understand the concept of Crypto-Currency and how large centralized systems DO NOT want these ecosystems to grow and revamp. Thus making it 100x easier to start building a governmental system somewhere that will welcome new change, not somewhere that shoves it down and says NO by putting restrictions and regulations on it.
